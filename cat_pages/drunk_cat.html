                <h3>Drunk Cat - 28/08/2024</h3>
                <p>This is a classic case of finding a cat on the way home from the pub. The image is very blurred because it's dark out, so the camera is using a long exposure, which isn't very effective when the camera operator is drunk. This gives a great result, though, which seems to make the camera reflect my inebriation; I love the seeing-double effect this picture has, it's one of my favourite cat pictures as a result.</p>
                <p>This particular night was a mini pub crawl. Starting at a very small, nice pub, moving on to a not-quite-as-nice larger pub, and then to complete the sequence, ending at weatherspoons.</p> 
                <p>I did get a free book out of it though. No, I didn't steal it (this time), my friend stole it then gave me the stolen property on the walk back. The book is called <em>Cosima Wagner's Diaries</em>. Doesn't sound like a book anyone has ever read. From what I can tell by searching online (no I'm not reading it), it's an extremely thorough one million word book laying out every detail of some guys relationship with some girl for 14 years until his death in 1883. Interestingly it was once very restricted and rare before 1970, and even after that only accessible to 'Bayreuth-approved' researchers. My copy was published in 1978 and has a note inside which reads:</p>
                <p class="quote"><em>I'm taking a risk on your recieving two copies<br/>love Patman<br/>20.11.1978</em></p>
                <p>I'm not sure exactly what this means but it could be because this book was published in two volumes, the one I have is the first. Either way, somebody didn't want it, or maybe somebody died, and weatherspoons got a hold of it. I like to think I saved it from that hellish place.</p>
