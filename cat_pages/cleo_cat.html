                <h3>Cleo Cat - 19/08/2024</h3>
                <p>This is my friend's cat Cleo. I took this picture the night before going on a long ~30km walk with said friend in the North Wessex Downs. It was getting dark around the time I took the picture so the quality isn't perfect, but I think the blurriness enhances the picture, infact I think this is one of the best cat pictures I have ever taken.</p>
                <p>Cleo is a very friendly cat. You can see in the image that she is waiting by the door to be let out since my friend's house doesn't have a cat flap. They should really get one though, I'd hate to be a cat without a catflap.</p>
                <p>If you look very closely you can kind of make out my reflection in Cleo's pupils.</p>
