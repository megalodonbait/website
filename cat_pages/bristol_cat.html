                <h3>Bristol Cat - 10/06/2024</h3>
                <p>This is a cat I spotted from the second floor of a student accomodation in bristol where I was staying for the night with my friend. It was very high up and I was worried it would fall. Turns out I was wrong to be worried as soon enough another cat showed up, and they had a quick fight, all without falling off, very skilled.</p>
                <p>The garden just below was the private garden for the accomodation (fancy) and included a ping pong table which we had a few games on, and the inside of the building had a pool table, I was very jealous. I think over the course of the two days I was there, my two friends and I managed to lose maybe 3 or 4 ping pong balls over fences into locked off areas, oh well.</p>
