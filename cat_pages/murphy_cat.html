                <h3>Murphy Cat - 21/02/2013</h3>
                <p>Murphy was my first cat, he was actually a year older than me. My parents got him for free from a farm a year before I was born, as a result he was quite a wild cat, and would sometimes leave for many days in a row. I have a very nice memory of coming out my room one morning to find a dead and headless rabbit on the carpet outside my door. Either he was feeling especially generous that day, or he didn't believe that my small child self could survive without his help.</p>
                <p>In the image, you can just make out some chips out of his ear, he got into a lot of fights in the neighbourhood, but we weren't really worried, he was an absolutely huge cat, and he probably owned the whole area.</p>
                <p>We had two soft red chairs in the living room, one of them was murphy's favourite. Nextdoor also has a completely white cat called morris. One day we came down and saw lots of black hair on one red chair, and lots of white hair on the other red chair, opposite. I can only imagine that murphy invited the nextdoor neighbour over for some kind of meeting.</p>
